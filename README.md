# MazeRunnerProject
HOW TO PLAY:
Navigate the long and complex maze, with white walls blocking your way. Avoid the red monsters. If you come in contact with them, you will die. The goal of the game is to reach the yellow triangle.

CONTROLS:
W - move up
A - move left
S - move down
D - move right

DIFFERENT LEVELS:
If you want to play another maze level, simply change the "MAZE_TEXT_FILE" from "maze_1" to another maze of your choosing. Additional mazes are included in the folder, and feel free to try them out, maze 3 in particular is the hardest. You can also make your own maze using a text file. Create a grid-like text file, with string characters representing different objects. An "X" represents a barrier block, a "." represents an empty tile, "P" represents the character, "M" represents the monster, and "T" represents the treasure. The program scales to different size grids so there is no limit to what type of maze you can make.


EXTRA:
This is a simple python game that I created when I was first learning how to code. 
It uses the turtle import to draw basic shapes and objects.
